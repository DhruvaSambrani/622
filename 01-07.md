## Example 2 - Hermitian Matrices

$H_1\*H_2 = \iota [H_1, H_2]$

$H_3 = H_1 \* H_2$ is also hermitian

## Example 3 - Symmetric Matrices

$S_1 \* S_2 = {S_1, S_2}$

However this is not a [[01-06#Algebra]] as there is no Jacobi Identity.

## Arithmetic

Set {S} with + and * defined.

1. $(S, +)$ is abelian group, with identity 0
2. $(S - \{0\}, \*)$ is a group with identity 1
3. \* is associative over S
4. \* is distributive over +

### Grassmann Arithmetic

Extension of c-no arithmetic.

$S = \mathbb C \cup G$

Where $\mathbb C$ is commuting, and $G$ are anticommuting, and c commutes with g. $g_1g_2 \in \mathbb{C}$. Hence, $g^2 = 0$, as $g^2 = -g^2$ and also $\in S$.

Hence, functions on $G$ are only linear.

### Complex Grassman Numbers

$\zeta = \eta + i\chi$ and $\bar\zeta = \eta-i\chi$
Where $\eta, \chi$  are real Grassman numbers.

${\zeta}$ is also Grassman.

$\zeta \bar\zeta = -\bar\zeta \zeta$

Complex conjugation interchanges order of grassman #s

## Exercise

1. $(\zeta_1\zeta_2)^\* = \zeta_2^\*\zeta_1^\*$
2. $(F_1BF_2)^T = ?$

## Matrices of Grassman Numbers

$$(AB)^T = -B^TA^T$$
$$(AB)^\dagger = B^\dagger A^\dagger$$

## Metric space

Non empty set S and $d:S\times S\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$

1. $d(x,y) \ge 0$
2. $d(x,y) = 0 \iff x=y$
3. $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
4. $d(x,y) \le d(x,z) + d(z,y)$
   
## Vector Spaces

# Theorem 1:

For $0\in F$, $\|0\rangle \in \mathbb V$, $0\|v\rangle = \|0\rangle$

## Proof

$(0+1) \|v\rangle = \|v\rangle = 0\|v\rangle +\|v\rangle \implies 0\|v\rangle = \|0\rangle$

## Linear Independance

Given a set of m non-null vectors, if we can find a set of m scalars $\{\alpha\}$ not all zero st $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i\|i\rangle = \|0\rangle$, then the set is called linearly dependant. Otherwise, it is Linearly independant.

## Dimension of Vector space

$\text{dim}(\mathbb V)$ is the max number of vectors which are simultaneously independant set of vectors.

If there is no such maximum, then the dimension of V is infinity.

## Span

If $\forall\ \|w\rangle \in \mathbb V \exists$ a set of scalars $\{\alpha\}$ st 
$\|w\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i \|v_i\rangle$ is called a span of V

## Linearly independant Span

It is a [[01-07#Span\|Span]] which is also [[01-07#Linear Independance\|Linearly Independant]] is called a basis set for V.

## Dual Vector space

$\|v\rangle \leftrightarrow^{\text{Duality}}_{\text{Hermitian Conjugation}} \langle w\|$
