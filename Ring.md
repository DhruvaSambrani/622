# Rings


$R = (\{S\}, \*, +)$

where, 

1. $(\{S\}, +)$ is an Abelian [[Group]]

2. $\*$ is binary [note 2](#note), not necessarily commutative, with a multiplicative identity [note 1](#note). $(\{S\}, +)$ is a [Monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid)

3. Multiplication is distributive over addition.

## NOTE

1. Some definitions do not require multiplicative identity. Generally these are called _rngs_
2. Some definitions do not require associativity of $\*$. 

## Special Rings

- Division Ring - multiplicative inverse exists
- Lie Ring 
  - $x^\*y = -y^\*x$ 
  - Jacobi identity - $x(yz) + z(xy) + y(zx) = 0$
