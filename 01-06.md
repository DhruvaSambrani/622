## Special Rings

[[Ring#Special Rings]]

## Division Rings

- Multiplicative identity exists
- But all x may not have inverses
  - if x^- does not exist, x is singular
  - Multiplicative inverse of 0 always does not exist ($00^- = 0 = 1$)

## Field

A field is a ring with 0 as the only singular point.

Example -
1. Reals
2. Rationals

### Zero divisors

For $r,s$ in a [[Ring]], if $rs=0$, then $r,s$ are called Zero divisors.

## $Z_n$

$\{Z_n, +_n, \*_n\}$

- 0, 1 exist.
- Group over addition
- Monoid over multiplication
- But elements apart from 0 may have a lack of inverses
  - Except if n is prime
  - $Z_5$ is a field but $Z_6$ is not a field

## Exercises

- Read pg 45-47 of P. Pal. 
- Ex 3.4, 3.9

## Vector Spaces

$\mathbb{V}$ is defined as a set $V$ over Field $F$ and a $\oplus$ vector addition

$\mathbb{V} = \{V, \{F, +, \*\}, \oplus\}$

Elements of $F$ are called scalars, of $V$ are called vectors

$\ket{x}, \ket{y}$

$\ket{x}\oplus \ket{y} \in V$

$a\ket{x} \in V$

Hence,

$\alpha \ket{x} + \beta \ket{y} \in V$

More formally,

1. Vector addition is commutative
2. $\oplus$ is associative
3. There is an unique identity for $\oplus$, called $\ket{0}$
4. Scalar multiplication defined, $\alpha\ket{x}\in V$
5. Multiplicative identity of F is also identity of Scalar multiplication
6. Additive inverse exists, denoted by $-\ket{x}$. Further, $-\ket{x} = -1 \ket{x}$
7. Scalar Vector multiplication is distributive over vector addition.
8.Scalar Vector multiplication is distributive over scalar addition. $(\alpha+\beta)\ket x = \alpha\ket {x}+\alpha\ket{x}$

### Algebra

An algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[Ring]] whose elements form a vector space over field F. The multiplication of this Ring is called a vector multiplication $\*$.

$\*: V\times V \rightarrow V$

#### Example 
1. $N\times N$ matrices.
2. Lie Algebra: Lie Ring [[Ring#Special Rings]] whose elements form a vector space.
   1. $\ket{x}\*\ket{y} = -\ket{y}\*\ket{x}$
   2. Jacobi Identity
   3. Eg. Set of antisymmetric matrices, with $\* = [.,.]$ - Algebra of orthogonal group $O(N)$
